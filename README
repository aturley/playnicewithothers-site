The main application is a Connect 4 game that can be played by groups
of people using their smart phones. When players join the game, they
are assigned to either the red or black team. During each round, the
players on the team vote for the next move; when a timer expires the
move with the most votes is played. Play alternates between red and
black until one team wins.
